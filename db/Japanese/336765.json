The exteriors of both cover and container are coated in roiro black lacquer; the cover and upper portion of the container's walls are emblazoned with a pattern of cherry blossoms and maple leaves in red and gold, which contrast with the black lacquer ground. Most of the leaves and blossoms--which are not connected and which lack any stems or scrolling foliage--are rendered in kirigane gold foil; a few leaves and blossoms are highlighted in red lacquer, while a few others are accentuated with bokashi kinpun gold dust. The lower portion of the container's exterior is embellished with nashiji gold flakes. The underside of the container and the interiors of both cover and container are enlivened with densely applied nashiji gold flakes, so that they superficially appear to have been rendered in a sparkling reddish gold lacquer. The overall impression is one of sumptuousness. The inclusion of both cherry blossoms and maple leaves in the decorative scheme makes this tea caddy appropriate for use in both spring and autumn.","totaluniquepageviews":125,"exhibitioncount":1,"dimensions":"maximum, including cover: H. 5.8 x Diam. 8.9 cm (2 5/16 x 3 1/2 in.)\r\ntea caddy only: H. 4.8 cm (1 7/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-03-31","dateoffirstpageview":"2010-08-19","dateend":1930,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
