Dotted with clusters of flowers and buds, the main branch rises gracefully in a reverse s-curve from an old broken trunk, which appears only in partial view at the lower right corner of the composition. To the right of the main branch, two new, completely straight, nearly flowerless branches sprout vertically from the old trunk as perfect parallel lines, in stark contrast to the curving branch of blossoms. A signature and seal, purportedly by the artist, appear at the lower left corner.","totaluniquepageviews":0,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 89.6 x W. 24 cm (35 1/4 x 9 7/16 in.)\r\nmounting, inlcuding suspension core and roller ends: H. 169.9 x W. 40 cm (66 7/8 x 15 3/4 in.)\r\n","dateoflastpageview":null,"dateoffirstpageview":null,"dateend":1499,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
