These botanical scenes are further embellished with exquisite renderings of insects -- a white butterfly approaching the blue morning glories, and a black moth clinging to a large pod dangling from the evening glory. Executed in ink, color, and gold pigments on silk, each painting includes an artists signature and seal.","totaluniquepageviews":1,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"Left scroll (painting proper): H. 95.2 x W. 41.2 cm (37 1/2 x 16 1/4 in.)\r\nRight scroll (painting proper): H. 95.3 x W. 41.2 cm (37 1/2 x 16 1/4 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-03-03","dateoffirstpageview":"2014-03-03","dateend":1899,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
