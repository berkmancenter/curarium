The outside ring includes twenty-two pine-needle clusters; separated from the outer ring by a single, raised bowstring line, the middle ring includes sixteen clusters; the inner ring, which is interrupted by a design of two cranes in flight, includes just seven clusters. The beaks of the two facing cranes touch just above the head of the striding tortoise, depicted from above, that serves as the mirror's central boss (from which a silk cord would have been attached for holding the mirror or for attaching it to a mirror stand). The mirror's reflecting face is flat and undecorated. The mirror, which is very heavy for its size, was cast with a bronze alloy rich in tin, so that the metal appears sliver in color. It lacks any patina.","totaluniquepageviews":4,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"Diam. 11.4 x H. 1 cm (4 1/2 x 3/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2013-12-02","dateoffirstpageview":"2011-01-11","dateend":1700,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
