Another adult monkey sits behind the first adult, facing front, with its proper right hand resting on his companions shoulder. A dated inscription and two red square intaglio seals appear at the lower right edge of the painting.","totaluniquepageviews":0,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 77.5 x W. 47.9 cm (30 1/2 x 18 7/8 in.)\r\nmounting, inlcuding suspension core and roller ends: H. 176.2 x W. 67.5 cm (69 3/8 x 26 9/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":null,"dateoffirstpageview":null,"dateend":1899,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
