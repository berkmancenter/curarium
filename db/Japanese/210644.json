The competing verses were sometimes accompanied by depictions of their authors. A tradition of painted poet \"portraits\" evolved in tandem with a taste for realism during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), although the images were based on imagined likenesses rather than on actual appearance.\r\n\r\nThis scroll satirizes those earlier literary and pictorial legacies by portraying the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac (rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and boar) in the guise of traditional Japanese poets. Each wears a sumptuously rendered costume--the tiger, rabbit, and dragon in the robes of high-ranking male courtiers; the snake in the exquisite multilayered dress of a court lady. Each is seated against a gold-misted ground beneath an appropriate verse.\r\n","dateoflastpageview":"2014-02-25","dateoffirstpageview":"2010-01-13","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC111866_dynmc","colors":[{"percent":0.68360153256705,"color":"#af9664","hue":"Yellow"},{"percent":0.17701149425287,"color":"#af7d4b","hue":"Yellow"},{"percent":0.057624521072797,"color":"#c8c8c8","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.020996168582375,"color":"#7d644b","hue":"Yellow"},{"percent":0.019846743295019,"color":"#194b64","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.017701149425287,"color":"#c8afaf","hue":"Red"},{"percent":0.01639846743295,"color":"#4b6464","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.0050574712643678,"color":"#647d7d","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.0016858237547893,"color":"#4b4b32","hue":"Green"},{"percent":7.6628352490421e-05,"color":"#327d4b","hue":"Green"}],"subclassification2":"handscroll","dated":"Early Edo period, late 17th century","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":"Edo period, Early, 1615-1704","url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/210644","provenance":null,"images":[{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC111866_dynmc","primarydisplay":1,"publiccaption":"Rat and Ox (section 1 of 7)","copyright":null,"renditionnumber":"DDC111866"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC111867_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":"Tiger and Rabbit (section 2 of 7)","copyright":null,"renditionnumber":"DDC111867"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC111868_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":"Dragon and Snake (section 3 of 7)","copyright":null,"renditionnumber":"DDC111868"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC111869_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":"Horse and Ram (section 4 of 7)","copyright":null,"renditionnumber":"DDC111869"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC111870_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":"Monkey and Rooster (section 5 of 7)","copyright":null,"renditionnumber":"DDC111870"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC111871_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":"Dog (section 6 of 7)","copyright":null,"renditionnumber":"DDC111871"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC111872_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":"Boar (section 7 of 7)","copyright":null,"renditionnumber":"DDC111872"}],"publicationcount":0,"objectid":210644,"subclassification":"painting","culture":"Japanese","permissionlevel":0,"department":"Department of Asian Art","markscount":0,"titlescount":2,"id":210644,"title":"The Twelve Zodiac Animals as Poets (Jûnishi Kasen)","verificationlevel":4,"division":"Asian and Mediterranean Art","commentary":null,"relatedcount":0,"datebegin":1600,"totaluniquepageviews":41,"dimensions":"H. 35.8 x W. 378.9 cm (14 1/8 x 149 3/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":1632,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
