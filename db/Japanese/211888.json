Executed with a relatively wet brush, the landscape elements appear as light gray washes of ink; the path in the foreground is reserved in white, which help to bring greater focus to the diminutive traveling figures. A signature and pictorial seal appear at the upper left corner of the composition.","totaluniquepageviews":0,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 24.5 x W. 41.6 cm (9 5/8 x 16 3/8 in.)\r\nmounting, inlcuding suspension core and roller ends: H. 97.2 x W. 46.7 cm (38 1/4 x 18 3/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":null,"dateoffirstpageview":null,"dateend":1916,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
