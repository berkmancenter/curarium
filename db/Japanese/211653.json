Its imagery continues the arc of a branch depicted on the other (right) screen and culminates in a scene of two sparrows perched on branches with clusters of cherry blossoms and leaves. The imagery is painted in ink, color, and white pigments over a gold paper ground. It lacks an artist's signature and seal.  The pair of screens originated as a set of sliding cabinet doors, as indicated by traces of circular damage at the midpoints of the left and right edges of each screen panel, where the handling implement to slide each door once existed.","totaluniquepageviews":1,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 33.7 x W. 122.7 cm (13 1/4 x 48 5/16 in.)\r\nframe: H. 52 x W. 146 cm (20 1/2 x 57 1/2 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-02-25","dateoffirstpageview":"2014-02-25","dateend":1843,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
