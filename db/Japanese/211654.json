In this whimsical rendering, a horned Wind God with bulging eyes and beastly talons is forcefully propelled backwards as he releases the wind from his enormous bag, the voluminous sack creating a round, moon-like expanse of white behind him. Graded ink washes around the figure suggest clouds, and a touch of red pigment on the mouth adds a note of ferocity to this otherwise playful depiction. The signature and seal of artist Kobayashi Eitaku (1843-1890) appear at the lower left corner of the composition.","totaluniquepageviews":0,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 128.7 x W. 55 cm (50 11/16 x 21 5/8 in.)\r\nmounting, inlcuding suspension core and roller ends: H. 206.4 x W. 78.6 cm (81 1/4 x 30 15/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":null,"dateoffirstpageview":null,"dateend":1890,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
