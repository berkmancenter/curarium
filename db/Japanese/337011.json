The text is written in a combination of Chinese characters, or \"kanji\", and native Japanese script, or \"hiragana\". Inscribed by Takabatake Shikibu (1785-1881), the poem is written in script that alternates between cursive, or running, script (Chinese, \"xingshu\") and draft script (Chinese, \"caoshu\"). Though not dated, this calligraphic work bears a signature of the artist in the lower right corner--i.e., the second column of text from the right is the artist's signature. The poem is inscribed on an album leaf of a type known in Japanese as a \"shikishi\", or poem card. At some point the \"shikishi\" album leaf was mounted as a hanging scroll, the form in which it appears today. In the present mounting, the album leaf appears just below the center of a long stretch of buff mounting paper, which is bordered top and bottom by a strip of white mounting silk with brocaded designs woven in gold; above and below the gold-on-white strips and along the sides of the buff paper is dark green mounting silk subtly embellished with a woven pattern; at the top and bottom of the scroll appear longer sections of plain, medium brown mounting silk, the slightly longer top section articulated with affixed (i.e., mounted in place) \"futai\" streamers.","dateoflastpageview":"2014-02-09","dateoffirstpageview":"2011-03-02","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC111251_dynmc","colors":[{"percent":0.59635327635328,"color":"#af967d","hue":"Brown"},{"percent":0.31356125356125,"color":"#afaf96","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.046096866096866,"color":"#967d64","hue":"Brown"},{"percent":0.018518518518519,"color":"#64644b","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.014871794871795,"color":"#323232","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.0098575498575499,"color":"#4b4b32","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.00074074074074074,"color":"#c8c8af","hue":"Green"}],"subclassification2":"hanging scroll","dated":"mid- to late 19th century","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":"Edo period, Late to early Meiji period","url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/337011","provenance":"[through ?, Tokyo, 1960s], sold; to Charles Craig, Jr., Santa Barbara, CA (1960s-2004), sold; to Stuart and Beverly Denenberg, Los Angeles (2004-2010), gift; to Harvard Art Museums, 2010.\r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\nThe text on a sticker attached to one roller end reads \"K889\"; the significance of this number remains unknown, but it possibly is the collection, or inventory, number of a previous owner.\r\n","images":[{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC111251_dynmc","primarydisplay":1,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"DDC111251"}],"publicationcount":0,"objectid":337011,"subclassification":"painting","culture":"Japanese","permissionlevel":0,"department":"Department of Asian Art","markscount":0,"titlescount":1,"id":337011,"title":"Poem on Plum Blossoms","verificationlevel":3,"division":"Asian and Mediterranean Art","commentary":null,"relatedcount":0,"datebegin":1850,"totaluniquepageviews":10,"dimensions":"calligraphy proper: 16.4 x 12.7 cm (6 7/16 x 5 in.)\r\nwith mounting, suspension cord and roller ends: 129.7 x 34.2 cm (51 1/16 x 13 7/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":1881,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
