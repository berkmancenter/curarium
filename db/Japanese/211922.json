Such robes are typically predominantly dark in color (hence the twilight description) and additional colors appear in gradual shades, usually at the lower extremes of robe skirts and sleeves. In this robe, scenes of a hilly, rustic village beside a body of water appear at the sleeve ends and above the hemline. Shades of light gray, blue, and green make up the landscape elements, while peonies, butterflies, and other motifs appear in pinks, purples, and browns. The \"yuzenzome\" paste-resist technique was utilized to keep decorative areas reserved in white, and colors were hand-painted. Some peonies were embroidered onto the fabric using polychrome silk threads; outlines of selected motifs were embroidered utilizing gold threads. Two floral family crests (mon) are embroidered in white thread on the front shoulders of the robe; three crests are embroidered on the back (two on the shoulders, one below the neck). The lower hem is padded.","totaluniquepageviews":0,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"H. 159.9 x W. 124.9 cm (62 15/16 x 49 3/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":null,"dateoffirstpageview":null,"dateend":1900,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
