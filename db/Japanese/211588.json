The subject of this exquisite painting derives from a fifteenth-century Noh play about a courtesan believed to be a manifestation of Fugen Bosatsu (Sanskrit, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra), a Buddhist deity described in the Lotus Sutra as accompanying the Historical Buddha Shakyamuni and typically depicted in Buddhist art as holding a staff and riding a white elephant. The imagery here is perfectly complemented by a dark blue and white silk mounting painted to echo the swirling clouds and flowing waves in the painted scene. The signature and seal of artist Ogawa Haritsu (1663-1747) appears in the lower right corner of the composition.","totaluniquepageviews":0,"exhibitioncount":1,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 92.1 x W. 35.7 cm (36 1/4 x 14 1/16 in.)\r\nmounting, inlcuding suspension core and roller ends: H. 181.6 x W. 54.8 cm (71 1/2 x 21 9/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":null,"dateoffirstpageview":null,"dateend":1747,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
