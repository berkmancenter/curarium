Kawamata makes many of these constructed model/drawings along the lines that Christo does -- both to work out the design in conventional ways, and to raise money for the actual project through their sale. (He doesn't sell the actual project components. It is simply staged for the public.) Kawamata worked on this project while doing a residency at P.S. 1 that same year.","totaluniquepageviews":3,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"Sight: 2.54 x 74.93 x 49.53 cm (1 x 29 1/2 x 19 1/2 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2013-12-03","dateoffirstpageview":"2012-10-18","dateend":1992,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Gift of Sarah-Ann and Werner H.
