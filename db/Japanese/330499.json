Its silhouette is exquisite, with an elegant arc dipping down between razor-thin points at each end, all surfaces glazed a subtle, luminous pale blue. The sculpture is accompanied by a walnut-faced, weighted display stand that was designed and fabricated by the artist.","dateoflastpageview":"2014-03-26","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-05-27","groupings":[{"group":"Collections Grid"}],"primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:LEG004541_dynmc","subclassification2":null,"dated":"Heisei period, 2008","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":"Heisei period, 1989-present","url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/330499","provenance":"Purchased from Erik Thomsen LLC-Asian Art, New York (Fukami Sueharu's dealer in the U.S.)","images":[{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:LEG004541_dynmc","primarydisplay":1,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":null,"renditionnumber":"LEG004541"}],"publicationcount":0,"objectid":330499,"subclassification":"sculpture","culture":"Japanese","permissionlevel":274,"department":"Department of Asian Art","markscount":0,"titlescount":1,"id":330499,"title":"Windy Seascape","verificationlevel":1,"division":"Asian and Mediterranean Art","commentary":null,"relatedcount":0,"datebegin":2008,"totaluniquepageviews":184,"dimensions":"H. 32.0 cm x W. 165.5 cm x D. 27.0 cm (12 5/8 x 65 3/16 x 10 5/8 in.)","exhibitioncount":1,"dateend":2008,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
