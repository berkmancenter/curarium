The circular base rests on a broad, short foot with vertical side walls. Resembling a cone with lightly rounded sides, the walls of the base dramatically constrict above the foot to form the slender column; above its midpoint, the column flares to receive and support the square top, which has a raised lip and delicately indented corners. The base, columnar support, and table top (including its underside) were coated with black lacquer; the table tops upper face, including the inside edge of its raised lip, were further coated with lustrous orange-red cinnabar lacquer. The characteristic black and orange-red and black lacquer identify this as an example of Japanese Negoro lacquer, or \"Negoro-nuri\". In the fashion characteristic of Negoro lacquer, localized areas of the orange-red lacquer have worn away through use, revealing the underlying black lacquer. Though still relatively thick on the underside of the tables top and on the upper portion of the columnar support, the black lacquer is now relatively thin on the base and lower portion of the support, revealing the dark color of the wood. Most Negoro ware was intended for daily use in households and temples or as simple ceremonial utensils.","totaluniquepageviews":36,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"max.: H. 34.1 x W. 32.8 x D. 32.2 cm (13 7/16 x 12 15/16 x 12 11/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-02-23","dateoffirstpageview":"2012-01-10","dateend":1599,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
