The fabric is a very dark blue silk with a design of densely packed flowers and vines brocaded in gold. Four square patches made of a contrasting salmon-colored silk decorated with gold designs of phoenixes flying amid clouds appear in the four corners, just inside the robe's rectangular border. Termed \"shiten,\" these four corner patches are said to represent the Buddhist Guardians of the Four Directions (Shitenn√¥).","totaluniquepageviews":0,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"H. 113.7 x W. 230.2 cm (44 3/4 x 90 5/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":null,"dateoffirstpageview":null,"dateend":1800,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
