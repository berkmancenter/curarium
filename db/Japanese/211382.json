The rider raises his right arm above his, his long sleeve draped above his cap so that it might protect him from falling snow. The horse is captured mid-step with his right hoof raised as he attempts to navigate the snow-covered path. Sparse grasses and a snow-laden pine tree appear at the right of the composition. A signature and red square intaglio seal appear near the lower right edge, between the pine and grasses.","totaluniquepageviews":2,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 45.7 x W. 65 cm (18 x 25 9/16 in.)\r\nmounting, inlcuding suspension core and roller ends: H. 148.3 x W. 82.8 cm (58 3/8 x 32 5/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-03-15","dateoffirstpageview":"2014-03-09","dateend":1900,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
