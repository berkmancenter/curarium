The rock appears in the center left of the composition and is rendered in just a few simple, broad strokes of ink wash, in contrast to the dark black ink used to depict the bird and sparse moss and vegetation on the underside of the rock. A signature and square red intaglio seal appear near the lower left, as if on top of the visible lower portion of the rock.","totaluniquepageviews":1,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 57.3 x W. 26.3 cm (22 9/16 x 10 3/8 in.)\r\nmounting, inlcuding suspension core and roller ends: H. 150.2 x W. 43.1 cm (59 1/8 x 16 15/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-03-09","dateoffirstpageview":"2014-03-09","dateend":1899,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
