The white tufts of snow-laden pine branches that cover the body and right sleeve of the robe in a diagonal direction (both front and back) were created using the \"nuishime shibori\" stitch-resist dyeing technique, in which selected areas of fabric were stitched and pulled together before dyeing process, thus preserving those stitched-off areas reserved in white, predetermined shapes. The pine trunks and numerous crane's bodies were created utilizing the \"kanoko shibori\" tie-dye technique whereby multiple tiny areas of fabric were tied off before dyeing in order to preserve small circular areas of white fabric reserved, the tiny white spots combining to create forms and shapes when viewed from afar. Other elements, such as individual pine needles and cranes were embroidered using green, black, orange, yellow, and gold-paper-wrapped threads. The lower hem is padded.","totaluniquepageviews":1,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"max.
