Revered above all others for the salvation it promised to all who recited, recopied, or even ruminated upon it, the Lotus Sutra became a focus of worship for generations of pious Japanese Buddhists.  Reading from top to bottom and right to left, this hanging scroll displays a section of the twenty-third chapter of the sutra, which was originally mounted in the horizontal handscroll format.  The extant text lists the disease-curing blessings promised to all who worship the Lotus Sutra and ends with the title.  The sumptuous paper on which it is written exemplifies a Japanese fascination with sprinkled gold and silver decoration that found its ultimate expression in maki-e (sprinkled design) lacquer.  Delicately painted lotus plants line the upper and lower edges of the composition. The lotus is the international symbol of the Buddhist faith, signifying the beauty and purity of the Buddha's teachings despite their origins in this impure world of illusions.","totaluniquepageviews":256,"exhibitioncount":3,"dimensions":"handscroll fragment only: H. 25 x W. 44 cm (9 13/16 x 17 5/16 in.)\r\nmounting, including cord and roller ends: 109.2 x 63.5 cm (43 x 25 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-03-25","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-07-26","dateend":1150,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
