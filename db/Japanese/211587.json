Executed in ink and white pigments on an otherwise unembellished gold ground, one heron bends its neck downward, while the other gazes far into the distance. The painted imagery is concentrated on the screenÂ’s left panel, with only a few willow branches stretching into the visual field of the right panel. The work is unsigned.","totaluniquepageviews":1,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"painting proper: H. 51.7 x W. 167 cm (20 3/8 x 65 3/4 in.)\r\nframe: H. 54.6 x W. 171 cm (21 1/2 x 67 5/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-02-25","dateoffirstpageview":"2014-02-25","dateend":1800,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
